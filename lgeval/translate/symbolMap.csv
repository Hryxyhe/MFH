# Example symbol and structure LaTeX mapping file.
#
# Whitepsace between commas is kept for patterns/replacements.
# Only symbols that must be replaced are listed; any other symbol
# label will remain unaltered after lookup in bg2tex.py.
#
# 'SYMBOLS' and 'STRUCTURE' are used to indicate which table
# is being filled at a given point in the file.
#
# Replacements are defined by (Pattern,->,Replacement) rules. For symbols:
#
#     symbol,->,newSymbol
#
# and for structures (i.e. a symbol with associated regions):
#
#     symbol,relation1,...,relationN,->,newSymbol,relationA,...,relationX
#
# where each of 'relationA' through 'relationX' match a relation on the left-hand
# side of the rule - this allows the order of arguments (e.g. for a fraction) to
# be defined. Relations on the left will be sorted alphabetically before being added
# to the structure mapping table.
