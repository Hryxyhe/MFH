CHANGES File

June 21, 2016 (v 0.3.4)
- Updated dates in README, License, etc.

April 4, 2016 (v 0.3.3)

- Corrected errors in src/sumMetric.py, where
  metrics for objects/symbols were correct,
  but for primitives edge metrics were being
  computed correctly, but reported incorrectly
  in Summary.txt.

June 9, 2015

- Modified call to perl to remove '-i' in evaluate script
  (was generating error messages)
- Changed segment relation detection code to compare segments
  more directly, rather than using component edges in each
  relationship (lg.py). Harold found bug where we were looking
  for automatic object identifiers generated for the input
  graph in the relationship pairs for the second (reference/
  ground truth) graph. 
- Corrected *S entries for .diff file output. These
  were being computed based on segmentation edge label
  disagreements, rather than the presence of one pair
  of primitives being merged in one graph and not
  the other.

- DEBUG:

  ABSENT nodes were 'matching' against target objects (e.g. single-stroke
  symbols). This was producing negative false positive values, and inaccurate
  precision values. Added a test in lg.py compareSegments() function to fix this
  (around line 710).

Major work on the library recently, including:

	- Changed metric output format for evallg.py, adding information for
	  detection f-measures; structure, object and relation detection and
	  detection + classification rates; relative correc. class/detection rates
	
	- Modified file outputs for evaluate script:
		- Now creating a human-readable spreadsheet (.csv) will all raw metrics,
		  to faciliate analysis in spreadsheet programs, statistical packages, etc.
		- Producing list of processed files with Correct/Incorrect indication
		- Separate directory for .dot graphs for files with errors
		- Confusion matrix file now has a separate plot for just relationship vs.
		  relationship confusions on edges, along with the 'full' edge 
		  label confusion matrix. 

		  * Significant effort to clarify correct merge but wrong class vs.
		    segmentation disagreements in the Summary.txt and ConfusionMatrix.html
			files (in Summary, for directed and undirected edges).

	- Created scripts to automate relabeling 'old' N/E format CROHME files
	  using '*' for merge edges (relabelEdges and relabelOldCROHME in bin/)

	- Debugging of metric computations

		- D_S (merge edge rate) was incorrect when segments are defined
		  inconsistently (e.g. only 'merge' in one direction, vs. both).
		  Corrected.

        - Removed computation of percentage metrics to reduce raw result
		  spreadsheet. These are easily computed, along with descriptive
		  statistics and distributions in standard spreadsheets/statistical
		  packages.

		- Various small errors related to when files are empty, have missing
		  primitives, or have additional primitives within them.
	
	- lg.csvObject() function will write out lg data in the new O/R format,
	  with a brief explanation of the format in the file.

	- Final touches on debugging/refining lg2dot, which I modified significantly
	  in early September to produce more readable output that is more consistent
	  across the different graph types.

	- Created file summarizing 'raw' metric data types and key data structures
	  in lg.py (which tend to be hard to remember).

	- **Added ability to use 'evaluate' or 'confHist' with either a pair
	  of directories, or a list of files.

	- Added lgOR and lgNE converters, so that files can be pretty printed
	  and/or converted easily between formats. Objects are still identified
	  by common labels on edges and nodes (i.e. '*' for merging primitives
	  is deprecated, although still accepted at input time).
	
	- Added cliff, ldiff and vdiff tools for finding instances/file with common 
          errors using regular expression matching over .diff files produced by the
	  'evaluate' script.

    - *Debugged lg2txt.py, which was not working properly with some labels
	  (in particular, for square roots using 'Inside' relationships). Also
	  updated the translate/mathMLMap.csv file accordingly.

	- Added ability to export a file list from structure confusion histogram output.
